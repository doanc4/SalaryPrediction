# Setting up the the virtual environment
This virtual environment was set up using pipenv, so if you have pipenv installed I would highly recommend installing the virtual environment dependencies by cd'ing into this directory and running "pipenv install". This will install all the dependencies listed in the Pipfile and version them properly according to the Pipfile.lock. If you run into issues locking, you can run "pipenv install --skip-lock" which will install versions of the dependencies that will work for you, but may not be the same as the ones I used.

If you do not want to use pipenv, you can install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
